## üìú Abstract

> "The ultimate practice tool. Instantly slice and loop any part of a YouTube video with simple hotkeys."  

This document provides an overview of the "YouTube Slice & Loop" Chrome extension, a browser utility designed for the precise analysis and repetition of specific segments within YouTube videos. The primary objective of this tool is to enhance learning and practice efficiency for users such as musicians, dancers, and students by providing granular control over video playback via keyboard shortcuts. The implementation prioritizes performance and a streamlined, keyboard-driven user experience.

## ‚ú® Core Functionality

* **Segment Slicing**: The extension enables users to define a sequence of continuous video segments. A starting point is marked with the `S` key, and subsequent presses of the `E` key define the end of one segment and the beginning of the next.
* **Keyboard-Driven Interface**: All primary functions, including segment definition (`S`, `E`), looping (`R`), and navigation between segments (`A`, `D`), are mapped to keyboard hotkeys to facilitate rapid, mouse-free operation.
* **Stable Mode for Playlists**: A dedicated function (`W` key) reloads a video from a playlist into a standalone player, mitigating playback interruptions caused by automatic progression to the next video.
* **Optimized Performance**: The extension is designed to be lightweight, ensuring minimal impact on browser performance.
